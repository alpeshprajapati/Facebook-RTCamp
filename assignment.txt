Part-1: Album Slideshow

User visit your script page
He will be asked to connect using his FB account
Once authenticated, your script will pull his album list from FB
He will click on an album name/thumbnail
A jQuery-slideshow will start showing photos in that album (in full-screen mode)


Part-2: Download Album

Beside every album icon (step #4 in part-1), add a new icon/button saying “Download This Album”
When I will click on that button, your script will fetch all photos in that album behind the scene and zip them inside a folder on server.
You may start a “progress bar” as soon as user-click download button as download process may take time.
Once zip building on server completes, show user link to zip file.
When use clicks zip-file link, it will download zip folder without opening any new page.
